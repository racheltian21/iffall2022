        <li> My name is Rachel Tian, and I'm a Communications Design and Marketing junior.</li>
        <li> I work a lot in the Adobe Suite, but I have never had much experience with HTML or CSS. I hope that this class will be a great way to introduce me to those! </li>
        <li> Like I mentioned, I do not have experience with HTML, CSS, or JS. </li>
        <li> I hope to takeaway some entry level knowledge on these programs, especially HTML and CSS, and feel comfortable implementing them into my future design studies.</li>
        <li> I believe this was mentioned in class, but designing for screens must account greatly for size. The viewer's comfortability with the size of the design is incredibly crucial when it comes to communication, and with the different modes of technology these days (computers, phones, tablets, etc.), it is important to take that difference into consideration.  </li>
        <li> I really enjoy the <a href="https://www.danielaristizabal.net/">Daniel Aristizabal</a> website, a graphic design website that utilizes parallax scrolling, video box, and in-and-out zooming to create interaction between viewers and the web.</li> 
        <li> The <a href="https://www.ibm.com/us-en/">IBM</a> website is an organized, eyecatching, and interactive website that includes both relevant animation, photographs, and subcategories within the website that help viewers navigate and understand content with ease.</li>
        <li> I personally believe that <a href="https://www.zillow.com/">Zillow</a> does a good job with their overall website experience. The home page is not too flashy or confusing, and it includes a search bar that lets you navigate anything you desire. Additionally it has different categories of exploration that are easy to find, such as buy/rent/sell, and within those categories are even more specific subcategories to help customers find exactly what they are looking for.</li>
    </ol>
