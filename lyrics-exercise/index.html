        <br>

        you said it looked better on me 
        <br>
        than it did you
        <br>
        only if you knew, how much i liked you
        <br>
        but i watch your eyes as she
        <br>
        <br>

        <br>
        what a sight for sore eyes, 
        <br>
        brighter than a blue sky
        <br>
        she's got you mesmerized 
        <br>
        while i die
        <br>
