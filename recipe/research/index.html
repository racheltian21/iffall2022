        <h1>Recipe for My Favorite Banana Bread</h1>

        <p class="section-header">Description</p>
        <p>With its super-moist texture, buttery banana and brown sugar flavors, incredibly soft crumb, and 1,000+ reviews, this is an undeniably popular banana bread recipe. You need 4 ripe bananas.</p>

        <p class="section-header">Ingredients</p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>2 cups (250g) all-purpose flour (spoon and leveled)</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
                <li>1/2 cup (1 stick or 115g) unsalted butter, soften to room temperature</li>
                <li>3/4 cup (150g) packed light or dark brown sugar</li>
                <li>2 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
                <li>1/3 cup (80g) plain yogurt or sour cream, at room temperature (I use Greek yogurt)</li>
                <li>2 cups (460g) mashed bananas (about 4 large ripe bananas)</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
                <li>optional: 3/4 cup (100g) chopped pecans or walnuts</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p class="section-header">Instructions</p>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Adjust the oven rack to the lower third position and preheat the oven to 350°F (177°C). Grease a 9×5-inch loaf pan or coat with nonstick spray. Set aside.</li>
                <li>Whisk the flour, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon together in a large bowl.</li>
                <li>Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat the butter and brown sugar together on high speed until smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. On medium speed, add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in the yogurt, mashed bananas, and vanilla extract on medium speed until combined. With the mixer running on low speed, slowly beat the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients until no flour pockets remain. Do not overmix. Fold in the nuts, if using.</li>
                <li>Spoon the batter into the prepared baking pan and bake for 60-65 minutes. Loosely cover the bread with aluminum foil after 30 minutes to help prevent the top and sides from getting too brown. A toothpick inserted in the center of the loaf will come out clean when the bread is done. Remove from the oven and allow the bread to cool completely in the pan set on a wire rack.</li>
                <li>Cover and store banana bread at room temperature for 2 days or in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. Banana bread tastes best on day 2 after the flavors have settled together. See post above for freezing instructions.

                    Sally's website caught my attention through its simple yet well-organized color palette, as well as its ease to navigate a video vs. written version of the Banana Bread Recipe. It contains a standard format for introducing recipes, with descriptions of the food at the beginning and the actual directions on how to make it at the end of the website. I definitely think it is a little bit of a hassle to scroll through an abundance of pictures and words to get to the actual recipe, but it is still easy for me to read!

                Simply Recipes is another great website for baking. It includes descriptions of what the recipe you are looking at is "filed" under, making it easy for audiences to understand that this banana bread recipe is an "easy breakfast" or under the "baking" category. I like that it shows photographs of each step of the baking process.

                I like that All Recipes is simple, short, and cuts write to the chase with the real recipe. However, I am not a fan of the way it shoves all the nutrition information into one line. I would prefer if each element was listed instead.

                    <br>
                    Minor detail, but I love the color palette and typography of Campos Coffee's website. It is simplicist yet conveys a very warm feeling in its soft green color. Additionally, I like the rounded corners of buttons and images, also adding to the softness of the website's design.

                    The Brew Tea Company website has a great composition, and each section of its information is clearly separated into hierarchal categories. It features different displays of the packaging design at the top of the page, which I think is super eye-catching. You can also tweak the number of tea bags/size of the box you want to purchase very easily.

                    <br>
                    A Perfect Plate's website is conceptually very reflective of its intentions as a environmentally conscious and unstressful way to get a meal. I think the pairing of images and the three big "slogan" benefits is very persuasive and visually appealing.
